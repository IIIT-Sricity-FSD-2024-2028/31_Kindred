# TeamName : 31_Kindred
# Domain : Non-Profit & NGO Operations
# Problem Statement: __Volunteer and Resource Coordination System__


Non-profit organizations and NGOs face significant challenges in coordinating volunteers, managing donations, supporting beneficiaries, and tracking resources effectively. The lack of a centralized system leads to:
* Inefficient volunteer management: Difficulty in matching volunteers with appropriate opportunities, tracking their contributions, and maintaining engagement
* Limited donation transparency: Donors lack visibility into how their contributions are being used and the impact they're creating
* Fragmented beneficiary support: Inconsistent processes for beneficiary registration, assistance delivery, and progress tracking
* Resource allocation challenges: Poor visibility into resource inventory, utilization, and distribution across programs

This system aims to provide a comprehensive platform that streamlines operations, enhances transparency, improves engagement, and maximizes the impact of non-profit organizations.

# Identified Actors
The system supports four primary user roles:
* Volunteer: An individual who willingly contributes time and skills to support NGO activities without receiving financial compensation.

* Donor: A person or organization that provides financial or material support to the NGO to fund programs.

* Beneficiary - Individuals or groups who receive assistance and support from the organization

* Admin - System administrators and organizational staff who manage operations, users, and programs
